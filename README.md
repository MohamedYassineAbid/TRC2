# 🌱 ECOFLORA🌱

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of **Tech Resolve Challenge 2.0** under the theme **"Sustainable Cities & Communities"**.  
It is a **Python Streamlit-based web application** that recommends the best crops to grow based on environmental factors and provides real-time monitoring and guidance for sustainable agriculture.

The system combines:
- **Machine Learning (Random Forest)**
- **IoT Sensors (via MQTT)**
- **LLM (Gemini-1.5-pro)** for intelligent filtering and recommendations
- **Real-time Visualization Dashboard**
